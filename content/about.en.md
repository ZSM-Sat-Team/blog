We are a dedicated team of students from the [Zespół Szkół Morskich im. Eugeniusza Kwiatkowskiego w Świnoujściu](https://www.zsm.edu.pl/) who are passionate about space, technology and innovation. Driven by curiosity and a desire to push the limits of what we can achieve, we proudly participate in the CanSat competition, where we explore the wonders of engineering.

Our team is made up of students with diverse talents, from programming and electronics to physics and craftsmanship. Each of us brings a unique set of skills and perspectives, making our team both creative and tenacious. Driven by the values of teamwork, perseverance, and learning, we have come together to take on the challenge of designing, building, and testing a mini-satellite.
