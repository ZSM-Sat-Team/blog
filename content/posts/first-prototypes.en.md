Last week we announced that we are in the process of printing the first prototype of our mini-satellite. Unfortunately, not everything went according to plan ðŸ˜’.

It turned out that the first version had several flaws: inadequate spacing between screw holes (our circuit board wouldn't fit), walls that were too thick (as much as 5 mm!), and insufficient space for mounting the parachute (the whole thing wouldn't fit within [regulatory](https://esero.kopernik.org.pl/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Regulamin-Konkursu-CanSat-2025.pdf#page=9) 115 mm).

After the first design failure, we immediately got to work on the next version of the case, this time using the more precise tools available in FreeCAD. [Sketch mode](https://wiki.freecad.org/PartDesign_Workbench) allowed us to use actual units instead of using coordinates, this increased the working time on the new prototype slightly but eliminated the problem with screw spacing.

In the revised model, the thickness of the wall was about 2 mm and the hole spacing was correct this time.

In both versions we encountered the same problem - the legs that we designed to lock the lids in place break very easily when any force is applied to them. For testing purposes, we fixed one lid with aluminum tape.

Thanks to the modifications, we also noticed a significant reduction in the weight of the case - by as much as 50%! The weight was reduced from 140 g to 70 g!

We are already planning the first parachute tests in the coming days, all who are interested are invited to continue to follow our blog and page on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100064050254272).
